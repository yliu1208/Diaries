## Work

What makes work enjoyable? My personal opinions are that, first, you are doing what you're interested in; second, the things you do can be challenging, but are achievable; third, you have supportive team members and good leaders. While I worked on my previous project, I really enjoyed that experience because I had great teammates who would generously help me when I came across problems. For my current project, I can still learn a lot of things, but I am not happy about the way how my leader communicates with me. He likes asking why I didn't do this, didn't do that, and telling me what I was supposed to have done. Instead of talking to me as if questioning me, he could have directly requested me or reminded me to do those things. Am I asking too much? Luckily my direct manager is super nice, who treats me equally with other colleagues.
