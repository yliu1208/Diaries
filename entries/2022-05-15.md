## Montreal Museum of Fine Arts

上午去逛了 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts，这大概是 Montreal 最值得去逛的一个博物馆了。场馆很多，展出的作品也非常多。个人更喜欢画作，尤其是能激发想象的作品，一些雕塑作品也很有吸引力，拍了很多张照片，空了可以整理一下。

中途让朋友拍了一张照片，也是这张拍照让我下定决心一定要减肥，照片里整个脸都是肿的，身材也肿，其实挺难接受照片里面的样子。It's maybe the saddest thing to realize how ugly you are especially when you are gay and single. I know that, in the past several years, I haven't really taken good care of myself. For a very long time, I just don't feel the motivation or desire to make myself look decent. And for so long, I've been feeling down, like there is nothing to feel happy about in my life, like I've lost the ability to feel happiness. Now I've become more and more unwilling to socialize with other people, even with friends. More and more I keep things to myself. It has also become more difficult to find people to talk and to confide to.

Friend Rui came to Montreal this Saturday, along with Ben. This is actually why I am visiting the museum today. TBH, I am envious of Rui. It's so obvious that he likes Ben, and he is enjoying every moment he gets to spend with Ben. He is in love, despite that Ben claims himself straight. I think Ben knows that Rui likes him.

## 太阳马戏团

也因为瑞的原因，下午快到五点的时候，三人一起去看了太阳马戏团表演。如今，不管在世界哪里，大概都已经很少有机会能看到马戏团表演了。I am therefore happy to be able to watch a live circus show.

1. 表演很精彩；
2. 看的中途，觉得很感动，因为可以看出演员都需要付出非常多的努力和台下的训练，才能在台上顺利地完成那些高难度的表演。
3. 观众非常给力，每到精彩之处，都会热情地给予掌声！现场的气氛确实很好。
4. 也突然想起，很小的时候，家乡小镇上偶尔会出现的，带有很强猎奇性质的表演，类似人头蛇身、蟒蛇之类的节目。

## 失眠

晚上很不幸地又失眠了。已经凌晨四点，还清醒得不行。Don't know why life is so hard on me. Maybe I have done a lot of awful/evil things in my previous life.
