Like in the past several days, I woke up at around 11 a.m. today.

Then I finished watching the _Emily in Paris_ Season 3. Overall, I think the _Emily in Paris_ is a good soap opera, given that nowadays very few tv series actually arose our interest to watch at all.

In the afternoon, I went with a colleague to the office and played Ping Pong for around half an hour.

The two books which I ordered last week finally arrived: 1). _The Portrait of a Lady_ by Henry James; 2). A collection of short novels and essays by Albert Camus. Both were published by the _Everyman's Library_, and I have to say that this publisher is absolutely a great choice for literary classics.

I started reading _The Plague_ by Albert Camus tonight, finishing around 1/10 of the novel. The novel basically narrates the happening of a plague in the fictional town of Oran, and the town itself is quite dystopian.
