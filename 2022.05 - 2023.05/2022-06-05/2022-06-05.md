# Sunday

1. Laundry
2. Bought three pairs of expensive underwear
3. Bought the _Effective Java Third Edition_
4. Jogged more than 5 kilometers

Started to listen to _The Daily Show With Trevor Noah_, and indeed found it entertaining.

One of the happiest things in the past week is that I received around $1,100 of tax return from the government this week. It really came as a surprise and it meant I can save a little more this month.

Personally I find that I feel happy when there are things to look forward to in my daily life. Expecting deliveries can be one of the things. Of course buying things also makes me happy :-). Guess I am materialistic.
