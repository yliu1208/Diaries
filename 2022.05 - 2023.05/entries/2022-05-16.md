凌晨五六点的时候，终于睡了过去，然后不到九点醒了。查看工作邮件，发现 Jenkins 的问题被（同事）解决掉了，瞬间很开心。原本也不是我的问题，但跟我提交的东西有关，所以我也得跟着一起处理，好在现在解决了，就不用再浪费时间了。

Nothing special about today:

- Had a little progress with my current task, and need to discuss with R&D to move foward;
- Helped the intern to partially set up his project;
- Played Ping Pong with colleague, and discussed a little bit about our own home countries；
- Took TCM and began to take Lutein in the hope of improving vision/eye health.

## Body Workout

- Squat: 30 x 3
- Push-ups: 10  
  Haven't done push-ups for almost five years.
