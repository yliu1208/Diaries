## Montreal Museum of Fine Arts

上午去逛了 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts，这大概是 Montreal 最值得去逛的一个博物馆了。场馆很多，展出的作品也非常多。个人更喜欢画作，尤其是能激发想象的作品，一些雕塑作品也很有吸引力，拍了很多张照片，空了可以整理一下。

中途让朋友拍了一张照片，也是这张拍照让我下定决心一定要减肥，照片里整个脸都是肿的，身材也肿，其实挺难接受照片里面的样子。It's maybe the saddest thing to realize how ugly you are when you are gay and single. I know that, in the past several years, I haven't really taken good care of myself. For a very long time, I just don't feel the motivation or desire to make myself look decent. And for so long, I've been feeling down, like there is nothing to feel happy about, like I've lost the ability to really feel happiness.
