I woke up at around 6 a.m. this morning, and couldn't fall asleep again. Luckily I went to bed before 1 a.m., so at least I had roughly five hours of sleep.  

I was pretty productive this afternoon that I made considerable progress in solving an issue, which had been blocking my colleague for some time. I am handling the problem because my colleague is moving out of the project and I have been assigned to tak over her unfinished tasks. Anyway, work went well today. Affected by recent re-infection of Covid-19, however, I still feel very uncomfortable the whole day. By evening, I almost felt drowning in fatigue.  

Hope I can have some good sleep tonight.
